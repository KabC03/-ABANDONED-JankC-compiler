main.c
compiler_structs.h - functions and expressions (use shunting yard algorithm)
storage_container.c - make sure array allocation works
rest of compiler logic

Stack - fix return values
Shunting yard - fix intepretation of Stack return values


Have option to intepret IR or compile it to asm for CPU

Check tokenser works

MAKE SURE TOKENISER DOES NOT ALLOW any '|' TO END UP IN OUTPUT TOKENS - THROW SYNTAX ERROR. OTHERWISE THIS WILL MESS UP IR GENERATOR WHICH USES ||| AS DELIMETER
