main.c
compiler_structs.h - functions and expressions (use shunting yard algorithm)
storage_container.c - make sure array allocation works
rest of compiler logic

Stack - fix return values
Shunting yard - fix intepretation of Stack return values


Have option to intepret IR or compile it to asm for CPU

Check tokenser works

MAKE SURE TOKENISER DOES NOT ALLOW any '|' TO END UP IN OUTPUT TOKENS - THROW SYNTAX ERROR. OTHERWISE THIS WILL MESS UP IR GENERATOR WHICH USES ||| AS DELIMETER

VM - Continue working on it



TODO order:

VM - finish completely. Also add debugger. Allow instructions to be shown, step through execution and showing register states/ram
Parser - Get working

Architecture specific assembler - Get working
Put it all together in main.c


Then go back and make sure everything works
